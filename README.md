## Emoji Search

All the companies use feedback forms to collect the user feedback on the products.

Emoji's are everywhere now, these text editors in the feedback forms are now expected to support emoji's.

Weâ€™d like you to build a text editor that will let users express more using emojiâ€™s inline.

### Task 1: Write a function to search for emoji

Create a function that will search for emoji in the `assets/emojiList.json` file for a given input.
        
Required:

1. The function should return a list of emoji's with the title

    ```  
     Example:    
              ðŸ˜ƒ :Smile
              ðŸ˜… :Sweat Smile             
              ðŸ™‚ :Slight Smile
              ðŸ˜º :Smiley Cat
    ```

2. The function should search the title and keyword(json file) to find the match.

3. Null responses should be handled with an appropriate message

### Task 2: Build an Emoji Search API

Use the function written in task 1 to create an API that will enable users to add a favorite tag for the selected emoji.

Required

1. GET request that will return a list of emoji's
